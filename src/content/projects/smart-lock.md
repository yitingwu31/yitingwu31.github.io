Cycling is a crucial transportation to get around our campus at NTU. However, it is very inconvenient to crouch down, reach for the key or turn the number knobs to lock and unlock bikes in a hurry, especially with food and books in our hands, and often times on rainy days. Hence, we built a smart bike lock that can be activated by swiping the student card or through a mobile app. The lock is assembled with laser-cut and 3D-printed components, and we used an Arduino Nano as the MCU, along with RFID sensors, servo motors and Bluetooth module to communicate with the android phone app. In addition, we attached a Hall sensor to the wheel frame, so that the smart lock will automatically locks up if the wheel is immobile for a preset period of time.

The project won several awards at MakeNTU Hackathon 2019, one of the largest hardware hackathons in Taiwan:
- Best Maker Award
- MediaTek Sponsored Prize
- Chunghwa Telecom Sponsored Prize
