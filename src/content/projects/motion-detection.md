This project aims at creating a simple archade game controlled by the users' wrist and full-arm movements. We used an Arm-based STM32 as the microcontroller along with its built-in IMU sensors. The game is written with Python's Pygame module, and the STM32 communicates with the Python program through WiFi socket. This project consists of three core parts: motion classification, data transmission and multi-thread system implementation.
