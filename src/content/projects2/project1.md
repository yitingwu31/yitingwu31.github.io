- An mmWave radar sensor that penetrates hard woodboard wall to count the number of people moving behind the wall.
- I used a xWR6843 mmWave sensor and the mmWave Studio Tool to capture motions behind the wall.
- I applied **Frequency Modulated Continuous Waves** and **Doppler shift** theories to practical problem.
- I explored around sensor hardware configurations like **sampling frequency, chirp frequency, chirp bandwidth**, etc.
The different sensor configurations affected captured data's precision and sensing range.
